# terraform-K8s-with-kops

In this project, I used terraform to provision an instance for kops. 
I set up the kops instance for creating K8s cluster, which I used to spin a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
After the creation of the cluster, I deployed a multi-tier Java docker application which make use of memcache, rabbitmq, nginx, and mysql database containers.
